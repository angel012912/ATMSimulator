## Description 

This project is an exercise in applying some REACT concepts I've been learning such as implementing simple components to make a larger component. This exercise consists of the simulation of an ATM where you can deposit, withdraw and see the updated balance of an account.


## Improvements

Some improvements I decided to make were: 

 * To validate that the amount of money in the account is greater than the value that is wanted to withdraw
 * Also, I decide to add a modify the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible
